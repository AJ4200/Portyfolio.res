Pursued a BSc degree at the University of Johannesburg, I take on small projects to further hone my skills. As a hobbyist, I develop mods for games, make music, record commentary videos for YouTube, and compete in online gaming tournaments. Let&apos;s collaborate and create dynamic solutions together!
