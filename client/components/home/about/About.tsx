            As a dedicated software engineer, I have gained valuable experience in building and scaling software for a range of innovative companies over the past 5 years. Alongside my passion for software engineering, I also possess a diverse range of skills in other creative fields, including cinematography, music production, game development, and content creation. With a strong background in web development and photography, I am currently pursuing my BSc degree at the esteemed University of Johannesburg while taking on small projects to further hone my skills, such as website building and game designing.
